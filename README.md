A project is a project designed to help patients with post-stroke spatial neglect, homonymous hemianopsia, or homonymous quadrantanopia.   

Albert's Test, invented in 1973, is a test that can detect spatial neglect and hemianopsia. Occasionally, Albert's Test is used for rehabilitation training, but there is not enough evidence from clinical trials.   

The project allows printing the test horizontally for offline use or drawing directly on the web using a mouse.

B project refers to Nova Vision's Vision Restoration Therapy (VRT) developed in the past to assist patients with homonymous hemianopsia. VRT is a rehabilitation program that has been criticized for the lack of clinical trials. However, I personally created this project because I believe it can provide the most visual stimulation during the period of neuroplasticity within three months after stroke. If the cost of VRT is burdensome, you can try this program.   

All rehabilitation treatments for post-stroke visual impairments suffer from a lack of clinical evidence. Hemi Reading Card is sometimes used in rehabilitation, but it primarily focuses on improving reading abilities rather than providing therapy. Nevertheless, even with limited clinical evidence, it is still worth exploring various options while neuroplasticity is active.
